###  Upon first loading the website the user will be taken to the index.php page. The idea behind our website is that it is a forum where users can ask and answer questions about topics relating to technology.

<p>At the top and bottom of the document respectively there is a Bootstrap header and footer. The left side of the header contains a Home button, which takes the user back to the index.php page, and an All Topics dropdown button to filter the threads by a selected topic. If the website user is logged in, the right side of the header will display a create a thread, user avatar, user name and logout buttons. However if the user is not logged in, the right side of the header presents login and signup buttons.</p>

<p>The left side of the document body contains, according to the selected search criteria, the 5 top thread titles along with a preview of each question. Threads can be searched for by typing in words or phrases contained in the thread titles and clicking the magnifying glass or hitting enter. </p>

<p>Upon hovering over a thread, the element will turn a highlight yellow color. At most 5 threads are displayed within the element at a time, and the user can view additional threads by using the arrow buttons at the bottom of the box. Thread pages can be jumped to directly as well, by typing in the desired thread page and hitting enter. Clicking a thread will display it along with all comments on the right hand side. </p>

<p>If the user is logged in, then an option will be a textbox displayed at the bottom of the thread comments where a reply can be written and submitted. A logged in user can create new threads by clicking the Create a Thread+ button at the top of the page, and entering the topic and body.</p>

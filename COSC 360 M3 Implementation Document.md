# COSC 360 M3 Implementation Document

## Team members:
- Luke Roblesky
- Jacob Harding

## Implemented Features:
- The user can browse for threads using a pagination technique, where four threads are displayed at a time in the left column. The left and right arrow buttons can be used to browse different threads. There is a number input that can also be used to jump to a specific page. The thread card data is loaded asynchronously using  an AJAX request, specifically JQuery’s ‘get’ method to the file ‘getThreadCards.php’. In the get request, the page number that the user is navigating to is sent as data. getThreadCards.php then queries the database for the details of the four threads that correspond to the page number and sends that data back, which is then dynamically displayed in the browser.
- The user can search for threads on the main page (index.php) using the search bar in the left column. This feature functions similarly to the pagination feature where a get request is made, but this time the data is the search text that the user inputted. The returned thread cards are the first four (or less) threads that have the sequence of characters that the user searched for in their title. 
- Clicking on a thread ‘card’ in the left column will load the thread in the right column including the main thread post and all the comments to the thread. Each thread card, when it is loaded using AJAX, is displayed using an \<a\> tag which has an href to the home page (index.php) with a get url parameter of the threads id. So a thread card will link to a page something like index.php?thread=5 which is the same page, but the php code will detect the thread parameter which is set to the thread id (5) and then make an AJAX request to get the data for the thread corresponding to that id and then display it in the right column along with all the thread comments for that thread. The html for the thread specifically is echoed out from the ‘getThread.php’ file and the thread comments are echoed out from the ‘getThreadComments.php’ file.
- The user can create new threads if they are logged in using the ‘Create Thread’ button in the site header. That button (which is an \<a\> tag) will redirect to the page ‘userCreateThreadPage.php’ where the user can enter the title, text content, and topic of the thread they want to create and then post the thread. The userCreateThreadPage.php file has the userCreateThread.js file which attaches an event listener function to the post thread button. The function does form validation to make sure all inputs have content in them, for example the user can’t post a thread with no title. This javascript file uses the ‘preventDefault’ function to stop the thread data from being automatically submitted. In the case that all the input is valid, a post request is made to userCreateThread.php with the post data being the thread title, thread content, and thread topic that the user entered. userCreateThread.php then adds this data to the database and if no errors were encountered sends back a JSON message with a createdThreadId property which is the id for the newly created thread. The userCreateThread.js file then redirects the user to the url for the specific thread that was just created by the user.
- When the user is on a thread page, which is any index.php page which may have a particular thread id get parameter after it (e.g. index.php?thread=5), an AJAX request is made every second to check for newly created comments that may have been made after the user loaded the page. The javascript code is in the getThreadComments.js file. It uses the setInterval method to call the method asyncLoadNewComments every second. Every time asyncLoadNewComments is run, it makes an AJAX request to getNewCommentsAJAX.php. getNewCommentsAJAX.php sets a session variable called last_check_time which contains the time of the latest comment that has been sent back to the client and loaded. In this file, the database is queried to find any thread comments which have a time that is more recent that last_check_time, if there are any, last_check_time is set to the time that thread comment was created, and then the data for that thread comment is sent back to the client to be dynamically displayed without the page reloading.


## Site Implementation Overview
All php files when creating a connection to the database use the file dbUtil.php which contains a function which returns a database connection. These php files then use the database connection when executing all sql statements.
<br>
The site contains several asynchronous features, which are all implemented using JQuery’s ajax functions, mainly the get, post, and general case ajax function.
<br>
When an ajax request is made for data that is to be displayed as html, JQuery is used to create the elements and add the data from the request and style the elements. For example, the submit comment button uses JQuery to send a request to the file submitComment.php which adds the comment data to the database, then sends back the comment data which is then displayed using JQuery.
<br>

The main session variable which is set to keep track of whether the user is logged in is ‘user_logged_in’. This variable is used to adjust the displayed html to whether the user is logged in or not. If the user is logged in, where ‘user_logged_in’ is set and has the value of the logged in user’s username, the username is then used to query the database for the rest of the user’s info that is needed to be displayed in any html. For example, the username and user image of the user are displayed in the header when the user is logged in as links (\<a\> tags) to the user account page. The user account page, userAccount.php, also uses the ‘user_logged_in’ session variable to ensure the user is logged in, then displays the user info corresponding to the user. If the user is not logged in, the page redirects the user back to the home page (index.php).

## Known Site Limitations
The password recovery feature is not completely implemented as there was difficulty using the mail() function to send an email to the user.
The sort by feature in the thread navigation column is not currently working.
